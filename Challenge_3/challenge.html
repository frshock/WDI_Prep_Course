        <!-- Part 1 -->
            <div>The actual content inside is 200px wide. The text is 
                padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom. 
                It has a dotted border 2px thick.</div>

            <div>This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it, the
                distance between the two is 30px. Overlap between margin
                is a thing.</div>
